- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mer413 - I tend to go by Mer as a shortened version of Amber.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning at least 3 new things every day in any topic I can. Never a shortage of options on things to learn with home schooled teens around!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with CSS and HTML code, and how to better fix sites up.
- 📫 How to reach me: amber@wppro.ca, or head over to our site www.WPPluginsAtoZ.com
